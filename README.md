# Memory Game Project

## Project Description

This project is a matching game where the player has to match two cards at a time until all the cards have been matched. At the start of the game, each player has 3 stars, but after 10 turns they are reduced to 2, and after 20 turns they are reduced to 1.

## Learning Purpose

This project is a project I completed as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to drive home the principles of pure JavaScript (no jQuery).

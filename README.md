# Memory Game Project

## Installation / Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:katherinebeam/memory_game.git
cd memory_game
open index.html
```

## How to Play

The timer will start as soon as you click a card. Your goal is to find each card's match in as few of moves and as short of time as you can. Once a match has been made, both cards will remain showing for the rest of the game. 

## Project Description

This project is a matching game where the player has to match two cards at a time until all the cards have been matched. At the start of the game, each player has 3 stars, but after 10 turns they are reduced to 2, and after 20 turns they are reduced to 1.

## Learning Purpose

I completed this project as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to drive home the principles of pure JavaScript (no jQuery).
